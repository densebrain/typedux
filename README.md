# TypeDux / Redux / ReTyped

A leaf based TypeScript 2 Immutable wrapper around REDUX - all decoration driven

_*Problem statement*_: reducers and actions are tightly couple whether we like it or not and string
typings are a pain in the ass - so call a decorator and let's get to work

```
NOTE: Runtime requires ES6 level polyfills - so babel-polyfill or transform-runtime, etc work just fine

npm i --save typdux 
```

## Decorations



### ActionReducer

### Action (Thunks)
